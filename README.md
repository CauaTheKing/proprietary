# Proprietary Software Licenses

## SYNOPSIS

Here is a collection of propietary software license templates & examples for organizations that produces
proprietary software.

But my suggestion is better **hiring a lawyer** instead of using this repository.

## Licenses

There are some [simple templates](./Simple.md) you can use in your code directly.

Also from a stackoverflow answer I found an [Adobe System's example](./Adobe-Confidential.md).

There are a [license terms template](./License-Terms-Template.md) from PandaDoc.

Following are GitHub repos about proprietary software licenses:

- [501st-alpha1/Commercial-Standard-License](https://github.com/501st-alpha1/Commercial-Standard-License)
- [licensezero/licensezero-private-license](https://github.com/licensezero/licensezero-private-license) or [here](https://licensezero.com/licenses/private)
